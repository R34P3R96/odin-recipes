Odin Recipes Respo

This project is to create a basic HTML driven website to showcase the current knowledge I have gained through using GitHub to create respitories and and Git to (git add) stage & (git commit) commit files before pushing them to Github (git push origin main).

I will have gained insight into basic file directory management for HTML websites, and additionally learned how to use the basic html elements and attributes to create a funcitonal Recipes website that will have links to some of my faux favorite recipes. 

I will also be using this project as a means to continue my CLS knowledge and capabilities, and growing comfortable with commiting file changes.

            <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>300ml Milk</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of Sunflower or Vegetable Oil</li>

        <h3>Steps To Make Pancakes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put 100g plain flour, 2 large eggs, 300ml milk, 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil and a pinch of salt into a bowl or large jug, then whisk to a smooth batter. This should be similar in consistency to single cream.  </li>
            <li>Set aside for 30 mins to rest if you have time, or start cooking straight away.            </li>
            <li>Set a medium frying pan or crÃªpe pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it with some oiled kitchen paper.            </li>
            <li>When hot, cook your pancakes for 1 min on each side until golden, using around half a ladleful of batter per pancake. Keep them warm in a low oven as you make the rest.            </li>
            <li>Serve with lemon wedges and caster sugar, or your favourite filling. Once cold, you can layer the pancakes between baking parchment, then wrap in cling film and freeze for up to two months.            </li>
        </ol>
